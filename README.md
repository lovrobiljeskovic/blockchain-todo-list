## Setup:

Backend(I used Ganache as my local test blockchain):

### `truffle migrate`

You have to then move the `build` foler to `client/src` folder so it can access the compiled json file.

Frontend(run the commands from `client` folder):

Installing dependancies: 

### `yarn install`

Starting the app:

### `yarn start`

Tests:

at root level run `truffle test`
